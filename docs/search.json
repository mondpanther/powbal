Besides helping to make energy cleaner this could also help to make energy more reliable. Making energy supply more reliable could have a big impact on economic activitiy in a country like India and therefore help to address poverty as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

India is interesting not only because energy needs to become cleaner but also because the un-reliability of the power supply there could be a big drag on economic growth. Solutions like POWBAL could help to make it more reliable. More details here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
