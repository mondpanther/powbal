# POWBAL in India

We are working with MIT's poverty actionlab on a pilot trial in India. What is the load balancing potential there? India is interesting not only because energy needs
to become cleaner but also because the un-reliability of the power supply there could be a big drag on economic growth. Solutions like POWBAL could help to make it more
reliable.
